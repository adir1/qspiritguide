# qSpirit Guide

## Branding Concept

Combining **Entanglement** (connection) with **Multiverse Navigation** (choice) and **Consciousness Expansion** (growth), you create a brand that feels both comforting and intellectually vast.

### The Hook

**Navigate the Multiverse. Expand your Essence.**

### The Mission Statement

Facilitate the expansion of consciousness through the lens of quantum entanglement. Our mission is to provide the navigational tools and high-frequency teachings necessary to traverse the infinite paths of the multiverse—assuring every soul that they are eternally connected to Source and perfectly positioned for their next leap in evolution.

### Why this works

* **The "Navigator" Role:** By using the word "traverse," you position yourself as a **Guide** rather than just a teacher. It implies you have the "map" to the multiverse.
* **The "Quantum" Justification:** "High-frequency" and "leaps" (as in Quantum Leaps) give a nod to the science behind the spirituality without being overly technical.
* **The Assurance Factor:** The phrase "perfectly positioned" is the ultimate reassurance for a seeking soul—it turns their current "confusion" into a "starting point" for their next expansion.

### A few "Quantum" Navigation Menu Ideas:
If you build the site, these could replace standard labels to keep the theme consistent:

* **"The Gateway"** (Instead of Home)
* **"Path Mapping"** (Instead of Services/Coaching)
* **"Expansion Lab"** (Instead of Blog or Resources)
* **"Source Connection"** (Instead of Contact)

Next investigate "Quantum Principles" or "Core Pillars" for your teaching that reflect this multiverse navigation pillars?

## 🏗️ Architecture

A modern full-stack web application combining **Astro** for the front-end with **Cloudflare Workers** for serverless APIs, featuring authentication, CAPTCHA protection, and a D1 database.

### Frontend
- **Astro**: Static site generation with server-side rendering (SSR)
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript throughout
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Deployment platform

### Backend (Serverless)
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless API endpoints
- **Cloudflare D1**: SQLite database at the edge
- **Cloudflare KV**: Session and cache storage

### Security
- **Cloudflare Turnstile**: CAPTCHA protection (privacy-first alternative to reCAPTCHA)
- **Cloudflare Workers Auth**: Protected API endpoints
- **Session Management**: KV-backed secure sessions

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Cloudflare account (free tier supported)
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Local Development
```bash
# Run Astro dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run Cloudflare Workers locally
npm run workers:dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the Astro front-end and Wrangler will serve workers on a local port.

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run workers:deploy
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Cloudflare Setup

1. **D1 Database**: Update `wrangler.toml` with your database ID
   ```toml
   database_id = "your-database-id"
   ```

2. **Turnstile**: Add your Turnstile site key to environment variables
   ```bash
   # .env or wrangler.toml
   TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=xxx
   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=xxx
   ```

3. **KV Namespace**: Configure session storage
   ```toml
   [[kv_namespaces]]
   binding = "SESSION_STORE"
   id = "your-kv-id"
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials with Turnstile token
2. Turnstile is verified server-side
3. Credentials are validated against D1 database
4. Session token is generated and stored in KV
5. Token is returned to client for future requests

## 📚 API Endpoints

### POST `/api/auth`
Handles login, registration, logout, and email verification.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "action": "login",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "turnstile_token": "..."
}
```

### POST `/api/verify-turnstile`
Verifies Cloudflare Turnstile tokens.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "token": "3D86db...",
  "remoteip": "192.0.2.1"
}
```

## 🧠 BMAD Method Integration

This project is organized to support the BMAD (Break down, Map, Adjust, Detail) method:

- **Break down**: Architecture separated into clear layers (frontend, API, database)
- **Map**: Middleware and routing handled by Astro and Workers
- **Adjust**: Configuration through wrangler.toml and astro.config.mjs
- **Detail**: Implementation in specific function files with clear responsibilities

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep API endpoints focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow naming conventions: camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components

### Adding Features
1. Create new `.astro` files in `src/pages/` for routes
2. Add API handlers in `functions/` directory
3. Create reusable components in `src/components/`
4. Update `wrangler.toml` if adding new bindings

### Database Migrations
Store D1 migrations in a `migrations/` directory and execute via Wrangler CLI.

## 🚢 Deployment

### To Cloudflare Pages (Frontend)
```bash
npm run build
# Push dist/ to your git repo connected to Cloudflare Pages
```

### To Cloudflare Workers (API)
```bash
npm run workers:deploy
```
